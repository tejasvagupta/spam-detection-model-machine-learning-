# Spam Detection Model (Machine Learning)

This project is a simple machine learning model for detecting spam messages. It demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance for spam detection tasks.

## Features
- Loads and processes a dataset of messages
- Extracts features from text data
- Trains a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not spam
- Evaluates model accuracy

## File Structure
- `spam_messages.py` — Main Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Common libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy (install via pip if needed)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tejasvagupta/spam-detection-model-machine-learning-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-detection-model-machine-learning-
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python spam_messages.py
   ```

## Customization
- You can modify the script to use your own dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
